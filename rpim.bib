abstract = {
Functional and logic programming are the most important declarative
programming paradigms, and interest in combining them has grown over
the last decade. However, integrated functional logic languages
are currently not widely used. This is due to the fact that
the operational principles are not well understood and many
different evaluation strategies have been proposed which resulted
in many different functional logic languages.
To overcome this situation, we propose the functional logic language Curry
which is intended to become a standard language in this area.
It includes important ideas of existing functional logic languages
and recent developments, and combines the most
important features of functional and logic languages.
Thus, Curry can be the basis to combine the
currently separated research efforts of the functional and logic programming
communities and to boost declarative programming in general.
Moreover, since functions provide for more efficient evaluation
strategies and are a declarative replacement
of some impure features of Prolog (in particular, pruning operators),
Curry can be also used as a declarative
successor of Prolog.

  abstract = {The work described in this thesis is the result of a research program
started in 1981 to find better ways of programming Telecom applications. These applications are large programs which despite careful
testing will probably contain many errors when the program is put into
service. We assume that such programs do contain errors, and investigate
methods for building reliable systems despite such errors.
     The research has resulted in the development of a new programming
language (called Erlang), together with a design methodology, and set of
libraries for building robust systems (called OTP). At the time of writing
the technology described here is used in a number of major Ericsson, and
Nortel products. A number of small companies have also been formed
which exploit the technology.
     The central problem addressed by this thesis is the problem of constructing reliable systems from programs which may themselves contain
errors. Constructing such systems imposes a number of requirements on
any programming language that is to be used for the construction. I discuss
these language requirements, and show how they are satisfied by Erlang.
     Problems can be solved in a programming language, or in the standard libraries which accompany the language. I argue how certain of the
requirements necessary to build a fault-tolerant system are solved in the
language, and others are solved in the standard libraries. Together these
form a basis for building fault-tolerant sodware systems.
     No theory is complete without proof that the ideas work in practice. To
demonstrate that these ideas work in practice I present a number of case
studies of large commercially successful products which use this technology. At the time of writing the largest of these projects is a major Ericsson product, having over a million lines of Erlang code. This product (the
AXD301) is thought to be one of the most reliable products ever made by
Ericsson.
    Finally, I ask if the goal of finding better ways to program Telecom
applications was fulfilled--I also point to areas where I think the system
could be improved.

  title = {Permissive nominal terms and their unification},
  abstract = {We introduce permissive nominal terms.
Nominal terms extend first-order terms with binding.
They lack properties of first- and higher-order terms:
Terms must be reasoned on in a context of `freshness assumptions'; it is
not always possible to `choose a fresh variable symbol' for a nominal
term; and it is not always possible to `alpha-convert a bound variable
symbol'.
Permissive nominal terms recover these `always fresh' and `always
alpha-rename' properties.
Freshness contexts are elided and the notion of unifier is based on substitution alone rather than on
nominal terms' notion of substitution plus freshness conditions.
Expressivity is not lost moving to the permissive case and the changes have significant effects
on the mathematical good behaviour of the syntax.},

  abstract = {One of the most fundamental tools in the programmer's toolbox is the abstract datatype. However, abstract datatypes are not widely used in functional programming, perhaps because they are not subject to familiar proof methods such as equational reasoning and induction~--- in essence, because they are a form of codata rather than a form of data. We show that proof methods for corecursive programs are the appropriate techniques to use. In particular, building on established work on final coalgebra semantics for object-oriented programs, we show that the reasoning principles of unfold operators are perfectly suited for the task. We illustrate with solutions to two recent problems in the literature.}

Our proposal is founded on a combination of a clinical trial (meta)model and WSRF (Web Services Resource Framework),and is currently being evaluated for use in early phase trials. Although primarily targeted at cancer research, our approach is readily applicable to other areas for which a similar information model is available.}

Imperative iterations using the pattern have two simultaneous aspects: \emph{mapping} and \emph{accumulating}.  Various existing functional iterations model one or other of these, but not both simultaneously.  We argue that McBride and Paterson's \emph{applicative functors}, and in particular the corresponding \emph{traverse} operator, do exactly this, and therefore capture the essence of the \textsc{Iterator} pattern.  We present some axioms for traversal, and illustrate with a simple example, the \emph{wordcount} problem.}

There are two main styles of datatype-generic programming: the \emph{Algebra of Programming} approach, characterized by structured recursion operators parametrized by a shape functor, and the \emph{Generic Haskell} approach, characterized by case analysis over the structure of a datatype. We show that the former enjoys a kind of parametricity, relating the behaviours of generic functions at different types; in contrast, the latter is more ad~hoc, with no coherence required or provided between the various clauses of a definition.}

  abstract = {It is a common phenomenon for research projects to collect and analyse valuable data using ad-hoc information systems. These costly-to-build systems are often composed of incompatible variants of the same modules, and record data in ways that prevent any meaningful result analysis across similar projects. We present a framework that uses a combination of formal methods, model-driven development and service-oriented architecture (SOA) technologies to automate the generation of data management systems for cancer clinical trial research, an area particularly affected by these problems. The SOA solution generated by the framework is based on an information model of a cancer clinical trial, and comprises components for both the collection and analysis of cancer research data, within and across clinical trial boundaries. While primarily targeted at cancer research, our approach is readily applicable to other areas for which a similar information model is available.}

Here we provide a core object calculus with an operational \emph{small-step evaluation rule} semantics, and a corresponding UTP model with a denotational \emph{relational predicate} semantics. For clarity, the UTP model is defined in terms of an operand stack, which is used to store the results of subprograms.  Models of a less operational nature are briefly discussed. The consistency of the UTP model is demonstrated by a structural induction proof over the operations of the core object calculus. Overall, our UTP model is intended to provide facilities for encoding both object-based and class-based languages.}

Further research into effective integration is required if these methods are
to have a significant impact outside academia. The Integrated Formal Methods
(IFM) series of conferences seeks to promote that research, to bring together
the researchers carrying it out, and to disseminate the results of that research
among the wider academic and industrial community.

Turku (2002); Kent (2004); Eindhoven (2005). IFM 2007 is the largest to date,
with 32 technical papers (from 85 submissions), 3 invited talks, 3 workshops,
and a tutorial. The success of the series reflects the enthusiasm and efforts of
the IFM community, and the organisers would like to thank the speakers, the

Our aim in these lectures is to provide a formal derivation of basic algorithms for coding and decoding. Our development makes heavy use of the algebraic laws of folds and unfolds. One novel result concerns a new pattern of computation, which we call \emph{streaming}, whereby elements of an output list are produced as soon as they are determined (and which has nothing to do with lazy evaluation).}}
