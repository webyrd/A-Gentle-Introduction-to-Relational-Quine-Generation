\chapter{Preface}\label{sec:preface}

% what is this book about?
% TAPL has a paragraph describing at a high level what the book is about

% relational programming
% the miniKanren language
% lots of examples



% why am I writing this book?

% language has changed significantly since TRS.
% new constraint operators, and a framework for constraint logic programming cKanren.  also, nominal logic programming, tabling, etc.  These topics are too advanced to easily fit into a second edition of TRS, which in MHO should remain focused on traditional logic programming.  Could have The Constrained Schemer could be a little followup, though.

This is a book about \emph{relational programming}. 
%
Just as functional programs model mathematical functions, relational programs model mathematical relations.
%
Relational
%\marginnote{If you know nothing about logic programming, relational algebra, or databases, \emph{don't panic!} This book only assumes that you can write simple recursive programs in a functional language, and have a reading knowledge of Scheme.  See the \emph{Audience} section below for details.}
programming is intimately related to both logic programming
and relational algebra, the theory behind relational databases.
%
Relational programs are unusually concise and flexible, often
displaying emergent behavior that surprises the programmer.
%
% Relational programming is arguably the ultimate approach to
% declarative programming, and may represent the next step in the
% evolution of high-level programming.

% I hope you'll find the relational style of programming as fascinating
% as I do, and will help push the statre-of-the-art in this important
% yet underused programming paradigm.

%% This book will teach you how to write relations that produce
%% interesting answers when running both forwards and backwards.  For
%% example, you will learn to write a relational interpreter for a subset
%% of Scheme: \mbox{\scheme|(evalo '((lambda (x) x) 5) val)|} associates
%% \scheme|val| with \schemeresult|5|. Of course, we can play more tricks
%% with \scheme|evalo|: \mbox{\scheme|(evalo exp '6)|} generates legal
%% Scheme expressions that \emph{evaluate} to 6, while
%% \marginnote{Douglas Hofstadter coined the term \emph{quine} to describe a program that evaluates to itself, in honor of logician Willard Van Orman Quine (1908--2000).  Writing quines has long been a favorite hacker activity, and quines are often featured in the The International Obfuscated C Code Contest (\url{http://www.ioccc.org/}). A delightful introduction to quines can be found in Doug's classic, \emph{GEB}: \cite{GEB79}} \mbox{\scheme|(evalo exp exp)|} generates Scheme expressions that evaluate to themselves.



%% This\marginnote{The Datalog family of languages is even more closely related to relational databases than the miniKanren language described in this book.  Datalog is more expressive than SQL, but less expressive than miniKanren or Prolog. Datalog is sub-Turing complete, and cannot express infinite computations, which is generally a desireable property for a query language. More on Datalog can be found in: \cite{Ceri:1989:Datalog}} book is about writing programs that ``run backwards.''
%% %
%% Such programs represent mathematical relations; we therefore call them \emph{relational programs}, or just \emph{relations}.
%% %
%% Relational programming is closely related to relational databases, and can also be seen as an especially pure form of logic programming.
%% %
%% The perspective of this book is somewhat different, and is based on generalizing functions to relations. In other words, this book borrows more from functional programming than from logic programming or relational databases.


%% For writing our relational programs, we use the \emph{miniKanren} family of languages.  miniKanren\marginnote{Information on miniKanren, including links to implementations, can be found at the official miniKanren website: \url{http://minikanren.org/}} has been implemented in Scheme, Racket, Clojure (in the form of David Nolen's excellent {\tt core.logic} library), Ruby, Python, and several other ``host'' languages.  miniKanren is designed specifically for relational programming, and makes relational programming easy.

%% Okay, that last part is a lie.  Writing relational programs is $\ldots$ tricky, hence this book.  miniKanren does make relational programming \emph{less difficult} than it would be otherwise.  What \emph{is} true is that writing relational programs is extremely interesting, challenging, and fun.  As in, ``I can write a short, non-obfuscated program that will melt your brain,'' level of fun.




\section{Audience}\label{sec:preface:audience}

\marginnote{\begin{quote}I have attempted to deliver [these lectures] in a spirit that should be recommended to all students embarking on the writing of their PhD theses: imagine that you are explaining your ideas to your former smart, but ignorant, self, at the beginning of your studies!\end{quote}\begin{flushright}\vspace{-1em}---Richard P. Feynman\\\emph{The Feynman Lectures on Computation}\end{flushright}}
This book is written for
intermediate-to-advanced programmers, computer science students, and
researchers.  For this book, \emph{intermediate} means that you are
comfortable writing simple recursive procedures in a functional
programming language, such as Scheme, Racket, Clojure, Lisp, ML, or
Haskell.  I also assume you have a reading knowledge of Scheme.
%
No knowledge of relational programming, logic programming, or programming
language theory is required.

If you want to learn about relational programming, but are new to
programming, Dan Friedman, Oleg Kiselyov, and I have written a book just for you, called
\emph{The Reasoned Schemer}\cite{trs}. In that book we assume you are familiar with the material in \emph{The Little
  Schemer}\cite{Friedman:1996:LS:230223}, which is a very gentle introduction to recursion and
functional programming.

If you are an experienced programmer, but weak on recursion, you, too, might
benefit from \emph{The Little Schemer}.  If you are comfortable with
recursion, but not functional programming, good introductions include
\emph{Scheme and the Art of Programming}\cite{Springer:1989:Art}
and the classic \emph{Structure and Interpretation of Computer
  Programs}\cite{Abelson:1996:SIC:547755}\marginnote{(full text at
\url{http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html})}.


If you are an experienced functional programmer, but do not know
 Scheme, the beginning of \emph{Structure and Interpretation
  of Computer Programs} should get you up to speed, while \emph{The Scheme Programming Language, 4th
  Edition}\cite{Dybvig:2009:SPL:1618542}\marginnote{(full text at
  \url{http://www.scheme.com/tspl4/})} describes the language in detail.



%% I have chosen Racket\marginnote{\url{http://racket-lang.org/}} as the host
%% language for this book, and cKanren as the default miniKanren
%% implementation, for several important reasons.
%% %
%% Racket's cKanren library currently has the most advanced experimental
%% extensions to miniKanren; we will need all of these features for the
%% relations we are going to write.
%% %
%% Racket is distributed under a Free
%% Software\marginnote{\url{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html\#SEC1}}
%% license, which is in the open spirit of this book.
%% %
%% Racket also has excellent documentation and debugging tools, and is
%% simple to download, install, and run.
%% %
%% The subset of Racket used in the book is essentially identical to
%% $R^{5}RS$\marginnote{\url{http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/}}
%% Scheme, the language used in previous academic work on miniKanren,
%% including my dissertation.
%% %
%% With the exception of a few Schemely features (such as
%% \scheme|call/cc|) that I explain where they first appear, this subset
%% of Racket should be easily readable to any functional programmer.

%% If you are a Clojurer and prefer to follow along in {\tt core.logic},
%% the first appendix describes the main differences between the cKanren
%% and {\tt core.logic} implementations of miniKanren.
%% %
%% It should be straight-forward to translate most relational programs
%% from cKaren to {\tt core.logic}.
%% %
%% Translating the implementations of miniKanren from Racket to Clojure
%% is another story.
%% %
%% I suggest you follow along with the Racket code, and then listen to
%% one of David Nolen's outstanding talks on the implementation of {\tt
%%   core.logic}.

\section{The Language}\label{sec:preface:language}

The relations in this book are written in \emph{miniKanren}, a language
designed specifically for relational programming.
%
miniKanren was first implemented in Scheme; over the past eight years
miniKanren has been implemented in Racket,\marginnote{Links to these implementations, and many other
 miniKanren resources, can be found at the official miniKanren
 website: \url{http://minikanren.org/}}
 Clojure, Ruby, Python,
and many other ``host'' languages.
%
There are dozens of experimental miniKanren implementations in Scheme
alone, and several other host languages have more than one miniKanren
implementation.
%
Like Lisp and Scheme, miniKanren is really a \emph{family} of related
languages.
%

This diversity of implementations and host languages has its advantages.
%
Interest in miniKanren has largely been driven by the popularity of
David Nolen's excellent {\tt core.logic}\marginnote{\url{https://github.com/clojure/core.logic}} Clojure library.
%
Claire Alvis continues to add advanced constraint solving features to the
cKanren\marginnote{\url{https://github.com/calvis/cKanren}}
(``constraint Kanren'') Racket library.
%
Other researchers and hackers are experimenting with their own
language extensions and optimizations, greatly accelerating the
evolution of miniKanren.
%
Unfortunately, this diversity poses a dilemma for both the author
and readers of this book: which host language and implementation to
use?

I intend to create separate Scheme, Racket, and Clojure editions of
this book.
%
Since Scheme is the language I know best, and since all academic work
on miniKanren has used Scheme as the host language, I have decided to
write the Scheme edition first.

%% In order to treat all my readers as first-class citizens, I have
%% decided to write three editions of this book, one for each of the main
%% host languages and implementations: Scheme/miniKanren, Racket/cKanren,\marginnote{Racket and Clojure editions of this book can be found at: \url{https://github.com/webyrd/relational-programming-in-miniKanren}}
%% and Clojure/{\tt core.logic}.
%% %
%% You are reading the Scheme version---you can find the Racket and
%% Clojure versions at the book's website.




\section{Goals}\label{sec:preface:goals}

% What is the goal of the book?  What do I want the reader to get
% out of the book, think about, or be able to do after reading?

%\marginnote{To some extent, this book can be thought of as an updated, greatly expanded, and much more accessible version of my dissertation (full text at \url{http://gradworks.umi.com/3380156.pdf}):\cite{byrdthesis}}

%The two high-level goals for this book are to {\bf make relational programming
%accessible} to a broader audience, and to {\bf describe the state-of-the-art}
%in the design, implementation, and use of the miniKanren language.
%

The goal of this book is to show how to effectively use miniKanren to
write relational programs.
%
%An important side-effect of these goals is to {\bf provide the background}
%needed to understand academic work on miniKanren.
%
To this end, the book presents a variety of non-trivial miniKanren
relations, written in what I consider to be idiomatic style, and shows
how these relations were derived.
%
Many of these examples draw from academic papers on miniKanren, and
focus on programming language theory (interpreters, type inferencers,
etc.).
%
Other examples, such as finite state machines, should be immediately
understandable by a wider audience of programmers.
%
To make the book as accessible as possible, all of these concepts are
explained either in the main text or in appendices.
%
This\marginnote{In this sense the book emulates Benjamin Pierce's outstanding \emph{TAPL}, which is about types in programming languages, but also contains excellent introductions to other PL-related topics:\cite{tapl}} book can therefore be used as an informal introduction to programming language concepts.

%% The high-level goals for this book are to make relational programming
%% accessible to a broader audience, and to explain the state-of-the-art
%% in the design, implementation, and use of the miniKanren language.

%% Specifically, this book aims to:

%% \begin{enumerate}
%% \item describe the current state of the miniKanren language, and
%%   its Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) extensions;
%% \item present a variety of relational programs that exemplify the
%%   relational style, and that introduce important relational idioms;
%% \item explain how to derive miniKanren relations from pure Scheme
%%   functions in a systematic manner;
%% \item explain in detail the canonical implementation of core miniKanren,
%%   and show how to hack the implementation to change or extend the
%%   language;
%% \item explain how constraint solving works in the cKanren
%%   Constraint Logic Programming framework, and show how to design and
%%   implement new constraint domains;
%% \item demonstrate how to debug miniKanren relations;
%% \item explain how miniKanren differs from related languages,
%%   including Prolog, Curry, Mercury, and Oz;
%% \item describe important open problems in relational programming, and
%%   limitations of miniKanren;
%% \item explain the rationale behind key design decisions for miniKanren;
%% \item use relational programming to explain important and interesting
%%   concepts from programming languages, such as interpreters, type
%%   inferencers, and Continuation-Passing Style.
%% \end{enumerate}

%% \noindent
%% An important side-effect of these goals is to provide the background
%% needed to understand academic papers and talks on miniKanren.

\section{Margin Notes}\label{sec:preface:margin-notes}
\marginnote{This book is set using the ``Tufte-Style Book''
  \LaTeX\ style, freely available from

This book is typeset in the style of Edward Tufte's
magnificent and beautiful \emph{The Visual Display of
  Quantitative Information}\cite{Tufte:1986:VDQ:33404}.  I share
Tufte's love of margin notes,\marginnote{Another great lover of
  marginalia was David Foster Wallace (1962--2008).  The \emph{Harry

  Wallace's love of margin notes is best demonstrated by his essay, 
 ``Host,'' in:\cite{dfw:lobster:2005}} and use them in this book to help solve the problem of addressing readers with
widely varying knowledge of computer science and programming.

To make the book as accessible as possible, in the main text I assume
the reader is the hypothetical \emph{intermediate-level} programmer or

Relational programs generalize functional programs, in that they do
not distinguish between the ``input'' arguments passed to a function
and the ``output'' result returned by that function.
%
For example, consider a two-argument variant of Scheme's addition function, restricted to natural\marginnote{The \emph{natural numbers} are the non-negative integers: 0, 1, $\ldots$} numbers: \mbox{\scheme|(+ 3 4) => 7|}.
%
A relational version of addition, \scheme|+o|, takes three arguments:\marginnote{Here we are taking a notational liberty, as \scheme|+o| expects 3 and 4 to be represented as \emph{binary}, \emph{little-endian} lists: \mbox{\scheme|(1 1)|} and \mbox{\scheme|(0 0 1)|}, respectively. Zero is uniquely represented as the empty list, \scheme|()|.  To ensure a unique representation of each number, lists may not end with the digit \schemeresult|0|.  This numeric representation is extremely flexible, since the lists can contain logic variables---for example, the list \mbox{\scheme|`(1 . ,x)|} represents any odd natural number, while \mbox{\scheme|`(0 . ,x)|} represents any positive even natural. \\ We can also perform relational arithmetic on built-in Scheme numbers, using \emph{Constraint Logic Programming over Finite Domains}, or \emph{CLP(FD)}; as we will see, CLP(FD) is faster, but less general, than \scheme|+o| and friends (\scheme|*o|, \scheme|/o|, etc.).} \mbox{\scheme|(+o 3 4 z)|},
where \scheme|z| is a \emph{logic variable} representing the result
of adding the first two arguments of \scheme|+o|. In this case
\scheme|z| is associated with \schemeresult|7|.
%
More interestingly, we can write \mbox{\scheme|(+o 3 y 7)|}, which
associates \scheme|y| with \schemeresult|4|; our addition relation
also performs subtraction.
%
We can also write \mbox{\scheme|(+o x y 7)|}, which associates
\scheme|x| and \scheme|y| with all pairs of natural numbers that sum
to \schemeresult|7|; \scheme|+o| produces multiple
answers, including \mbox{\scheme|x = 3|} and \mbox{\scheme|y = 4|}, and
\mbox{\scheme|x = 0|} and \mbox{\scheme|y = 7|}.
%
Finally, we can write \mbox{\scheme|(+o x y z)|}, which enumerates 
all triples of natural numbers $(x, y, z)$ such that $x + y = z$; 
 \scheme|+o| produces infinitely many answers.
%
Informally, we say that the call \mbox{\scheme|(+o 3 4 z)|} runs the \scheme|+o| relation ``forwards,''
%(that is, in the same direction as the corresponding Scheme function),
while the calls \mbox{\scheme|(+o 3 y 7)|}, \mbox{\scheme|(+o x y 7)|}, and \mbox{\scheme|(+o x y z)|} run ``backwards.''
%Informally, we say that the \scheme|+o| relation can ``run backwards,'' in
%contrast to Scheme's \scheme|+| function, which only can be used in the
%``forwards'' direction.

We will see that the remarkable flexibility of the \scheme|+o|
relation is exhibited by more complex relations, such as interpreters,
type inferencers, and finite-state machines.
%
For example, we will write a relational interpreter for a subset
of Scheme, \scheme|evalo|. Running \scheme|evalo| forwards, the call\marginnote{As might be expected, \scheme|evalo| will interpret the quoted list \mbox{\schemeresult|(+ x 2)|} as the call \mbox{\scheme|(+o x 2 val)|}, where the logic variable \scheme|x| is associated with \schemeresult|4|.}
\mbox{\scheme|(evalo '((lambda (x) (+ x 2)) 4) val)|} associates
\scheme|val| with \schemeresult|6|. Running 
backwards is more interesting: \mbox{\scheme|(evalo exp '6)|} generates legal
Scheme expressions that \emph{evaluate} to 6, while
\mbox{\scheme|(evalo exp exp)|} generates \emph{quines}, which are Scheme expressions that evaluate to themselves.

%\marginnote{Douglas Hofstadter coined the term \emph{quine}, in honor of logician Willard Van Orman Quine (1908--2000).  Writing quines has long been a favorite hacker activity, and quines are often featured in the The International Obfuscated C Code Contest (\url{http://www.ioccc.org/}). A delightful introduction to quines can be found in Doug's classic, \emph{GEB}: \cite{GEB79}}

%This book will teach you how to write relations that produce
%interesting answers when running forwards and backwards.
%
%Running a relation in the forward direction is usually straight-forward.
%
%Running a relation backwards is where the fun begins.\marginnote{All
%too often this fun never ends, as the relation diverges (loops forever)!}
%
%I hope you'll enjoy the neverending fun of relational programming as
%much as I have.



%%% I need to decide who my intended audience is, and always keep them
%%% in mind.  I need to be especially careful about referring to
%%% things PL folks and CS PhDs take for granted.  In the margin notes
%%% I can geek out all I want.


%%% Do I believe this?  Yes.  However, unless the reader knows what logic programming is, this claim won't mean much.

% Logic programming has failed.

% More specifically, logic programming, as currently practiced, has failed to live up to its promise as the ultimate in declarative programming.



%%% I guess this paragraph is okay, as far as it goes.  But once
%%% again, mind my audience.  Also, concentrate on ideas over specific
%%% languages or implementations whenever possible.  Want the book to
%%% be useful and interesting even for readers who have no interest in
%%% ever using miniKanren.

% This book describes the miniKanren programming language\marginnote{miniKanren is actually a family of related programming languages, embedded in a variety of host languages. Unless otherwise specifified, we use the term ``miniKanren'' to refer to the entire family of languages, including {\tt core.logic}, cKanren, and any other variants.}, and how to use miniKanren to write programs in a {\em relational} style.  Just as functional programming is based on the notion of mathematical functions, relational programming is based on the notion of mathematical relations.  For this reason, relational programs are in some ways similar to relational databases.\marginnote{Indeed, SQL is arguably the most successful relational (and declarative) programming language.  As we will see, miniKanren is more expressive than SQL, although this increased expressivity has disadvantages.}  Relational programming goes beyond relatioal databases, however, and can be seen as an especially pure variant of logic programming.  Although both views of relational programming are valid and useful, we shall concentrate on an alternate, complementary view of relational programming, based on the transformation of functions in a functional programming language to relations in miniKanren.
