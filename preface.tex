\emph{I think the weakest way to solve a problem is just to solve it; that's what they teach in elementary school. In some math and science courses they often teach you it's better to change the problem. I think it's much better to change the context in which the problem is being stated. Some years ago, Marvin Minsky said, ``You don't understand something until you understand it more than one way.'' I think that what we're going to have to learn is the notion that we have to have multiple points of view.}
