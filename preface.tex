\chapter{Preface}

%%% SPJ style: describe contributions first.  Then, write to satisfy
%%% the contributions.  I'm done writing once I've backed up all of
%%% the claimed contributions.


% One important goal of the book is to make other resources on
% miniKanren more accessible.  PL-specific terms should be described,
% or at least the reader should be given very specific pointers to
% additional, accessible reading.

% Critical questions that should be answered in the preface:

% What is the goal of the book?  What do I want the reader to get
% out of the book, think about, or be able to do after reading?

% Who is the intended audience?  (Always keep this in mind...)  For
% the Little books, the intended reader is a bright but ignorant high
% school student.

% What is the required background of the reader?  Tied closely to the
% first question, obviously.
