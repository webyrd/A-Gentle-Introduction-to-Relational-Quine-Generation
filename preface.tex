\chapter{Preface}

\section{Audience}

This\marginnote{}  book is written for
intermediate-to-advanced programmers, computer science students, and
researchers.  For this book, \emph{intermediate} means that you are
comfortable writing simple recursive procedures in a functional
programming language, such as Scheme, Racket, Clojure, Lisp, ML, or
Haskell.  I also assume you have a reading knowledge of Scheme.
%
No knowledge of relational programming, logic programming, programming
language theory, or miniKanren is required.

Most importantly, you should be prepared to have your mind blown by
the awesomeness that is relational programming.

If you want to learn about relational programming, but are new to
programming, are you in luck!  I co-wrote another book just for you,
\emph{The Reasoned Schemer}\cite{trs}. You might first read \emph{The Little
  Schemer (4th ed.)}\cite{Friedman:1996:LS:230223}, a very gentle introduction to recursion and
functional programming.

If you are an experienced programmer, but weak on recursion, you might
benefit from \emph{The Little Schemer}.  If you are comfortable with
recursion, but not functional programming, good introductions include
\emph{Scheme and the Art of Programming}\cite{Springer:1989:Art} and
the classic \emph{Structure and Interpretation of Computer
  Programs (2nd ed.)}\cite{Abelson:1996:SIC:547755} (full text at
\url{http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html}).

If you are an experienced functional programmer, but do not know
Scheme, the beginning of \emph{Structure and Interpretation of
  Computer Programs} should get you up to speed, while \emph{The
  Scheme Programming Language, 4th Edition}\cite{Dybvig:2009:SPL:1618542} (full text at
\url{http://www.scheme.com/tspl4/}) describes the language in detail.

% Rules: try to target intermediate-to-advanced hobbyists, working
% programmers, and undergrad students in main text.  Allowed to geek
% out in margin notes: anything can go!  Intro chapters and appendices
% will help bring intermediate reader up to speed on CS (and,
% especially, PL-related) topics, such as interpreters, continuations,
% type theory, and program transformations.  This shouldn't be too
% boring, though, since can followup these chapters with the same
% ideas demonstrated relationally (for example, relational
% interpreters, relational CSPer, etc.)  Advanced, optional chapters
% and appendices can explore topics of arbitrary complexity.



%%% SPJ style: describe contributions first.  Then, write to satisfy
%%% the contributions.  I'm done writing once I've backed up all of
%%% the claimed contributions.


% An important goal of the book is to make other resources on
% miniKanren more accessible.  PL-specific terms should be described,
% or at least the reader should be given very specific pointers to
% additional, accessible reading.




% Critical questions that should be answered in the preface:

% What is the goal of the book?  What do I want the reader to get
% out of the book, think about, or be able to do after reading?

% Who is the intended audience?  (Always keep this in mind...)  For
% the Little books, the intended reader is a bright but ignorant high
% school student.

% What is the required background of the reader?  Tied closely to the
% first question, obviously.
