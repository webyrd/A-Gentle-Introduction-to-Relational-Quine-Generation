\emph{I think the weakest way to solve a problem is just to solve it; that's what they teach in elementary school. In some math and science courses they often teach you it's better to change the problem. I think it's much better to change the context in which the problem is being stated. Some years ago, Marvin Minsky said, ``You don't understand something until you understand it more than one way.'' I think that what we're going to have to learn is the notion that we have to have multiple points of view.}

This book is about changing the context in which computational
problems are stated, attempting to understand these problems from the
viewpoint of relational programming.


In elementary school I learned to multiply small whole numbers by
memorization: I memorized the fact that 3 times 4 is 12.
%
I also learned how to handle larger numbers by repeatedly
multiplifying pairs of digits---one digit from each number---so that I
could apply my mental collection of facts.
%
My classmates and I solved countless multiplication problems without
the faintest idea that we using ideas fundamental to computing:
following an algorithm, lookuping up pre-computed partial results,
using recursion to simplify a complex problem.
%
We learned to just solve the problem.

Later, in a math course, I learned that numbers can be represented in
binary: the multiplication problem $3 \times 4$ can be changed into
the equivalent binary multiplication problem $11_2 \times 100_2$.
%
I also learned that multiplying a number by 4 in binary is equivalent
to adding two 0's to the end of that number: $11_2$ multiplied by 4 is
$1100_2$, which is the binary representation of 12.
%
On many computers, using a ``shift left'' instruction to add two 0's to
the end of a binary number is faster than multiplying the number by 4.
%
I learned it is often better to change the problem.



% What happens if we take the relational view of computation seriously?

% changing context: what is so special about the 3 and 4?  Why do they get all the fun?  Why is 12 left out in the cold?  Isn't 12 just as important as 3 and 4?






Alan J. Perlis said, ``A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.''\footnote{Epigram 19 from ``Epigrams on Programming''~\cite{Perlis:1982:SFE:947955.1083808}.\\Also at \url{http://www.cs.yale.edu/quotes.html}.}
%
The point of view we shall adopt in this book is, ``A program that doesn't run backwards is not worth writing.''
