\chapter{Preface}

% Audience: developers/students/researchers with
% intermediate-to-advanced knowledge of computer science and
% programming.  The reader should be comfortable with basic functional
% programming (should be able to write basic recursive functions, as
% in The Little Schemer).  Knowledge of fundamental programming
% languages theory is helpful, but not necessary.  Most importantly,
% the reader should be prepared to be rocked by the awesomeness that
% is relational programming.

%                                      |--- main text -----|-- margin notes ---|

% Rules: try to target intermediate-to-advanced hobbyists, working
% programmers, and undergrad students in main text.  Allowed to geek
% out in margin notes: anything can go!  Intro chapters and appendices
% will help bring intermediate reader up to speed on CS (and,
% especially, PL-related) topics, such as interpreters, continuations,
% type theory, and program transformations.  This shouldn't be too
% boring, though, since can followup these chapters with the same
% ideas demonstrated relationally (for example, relational
% interpreters, relational CSPer, etc.)  Advanced, optional chapters
% and appendices can explore topics of arbitrary complexity.



%%% SPJ style: describe contributions first.  Then, write to satisfy
%%% the contributions.  I'm done writing once I've backed up all of
%%% the claimed contributions.


% An important goal of the book is to make other resources on
% miniKanren more accessible.  PL-specific terms should be described,
% or at least the reader should be given very specific pointers to
% additional, accessible reading.




% Critical questions that should be answered in the preface:

% What is the goal of the book?  What do I want the reader to get
% out of the book, think about, or be able to do after reading?

% Who is the intended audience?  (Always keep this in mind...)  For
% the Little books, the intended reader is a bright but ignorant high
% school student.

% What is the required background of the reader?  Tied closely to the
% first question, obviously.
