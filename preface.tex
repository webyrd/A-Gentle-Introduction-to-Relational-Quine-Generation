\chapter{Preface}

% what is this book about?
% TAPL has a paragraph describing at a high level what the book is about

% relational programming
% the miniKanren language
% lots of examples



% why am I writing this book?

% language has changed significantly since TRS.
% new constraint operators, and a framework for constraint logic programming cKanren.  also, nominal logic programming, tabling, etc.  These topics are too advanced to easily fit into a second edition of TRS, which in MHO should remain focused on traditional logic programming.  Could have The Constrained Schemer could be a little followup, though.

\section{Audience}\label{sec:preface:audience}

\marginnote{\begin{quote}I have attempted to deliver [these lectures] in a spirit that should be recommended to all students embarking on the writing of their PhD theses: imagine that you are explaining your ideas to your former smart, but ignorant, self, at the beginning of your studies!\end{quote}\begin{flushright}\vspace{-1em}---Richard P. Feynman\\\emph{The Feynman Lectures on Computation}\end{flushright}}
This book is written for
intermediate-to-advanced programmers, computer science students, and
researchers.  For this book, \emph{intermediate} means that you are
comfortable writing simple recursive procedures in a functional
programming language, such as Scheme, Racket, Clojure, Lisp, ML, or
Haskell.  I also assume you have a reading knowledge of Scheme.
%
No knowledge of relational programming, logic programming, or programming
language theory is required.

If you want to learn about relational programming, but are new to
programming, Dan Friedman, Oleg Kiselyov, and I have written a book just for you, called
\emph{The Reasoned Schemer}\cite{trs}. In that book we assume you are familiar with the material in \emph{The Little
  Schemer}\cite{Friedman:1996:LS:230223}, which is a very gentle introduction to recursion and
functional programming.

If you are an experienced programmer, but weak on recursion, you, too, might
benefit from \emph{The Little Schemer}.  If you are comfortable with
recursion, but not functional programming, good introductions include
\emph{Scheme and the Art of Programming}\cite{Springer:1989:Art} and
the classic \emph{Structure and Interpretation of Computer
  Programs}\cite{Abelson:1996:SIC:547755}\marginnote{(full text at
\url{http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html})}.

If you are an experienced functional programmer, but do not know
Scheme, the beginning of \emph{Structure and Interpretation of
  Computer Programs} should get you up to speed, while \emph{The
  Scheme Programming Language, 4th Edition}\cite{Dybvig:2009:SPL:1618542}\marginnote{(full text at
\url{http://www.scheme.com/tspl4/})} describes the language in detail.


\section{Goals}\label{sec:preface:goals}

% What is the goal of the book?  What do I want the reader to get
% out of the book, think about, or be able to do after reading?

% An important goal of the book is to make other resources on
% miniKanren more accessible.  PL-specific terms should be described,
% or at least the reader should be given very specific pointers to
% additional, accessible reading.

% Decribe the current state-of-the-art for relational programming in
% miniKanren.

% Show, in detail, how miniKanren relations can be derived from
% pure Scheme functions.

% Give many examples of non-trivial relations, show how these programs
% were derived.  These examples should include non-PL-related
% relations of wide interest to programmers, such as finite state
% machines.

% Give examples of good relational style.

% Give a more detailed explanation of the miniKanren implementation than is found in TRS or our academic papers.  Show how to hack the implementation to change the behavior of miniKanren, or add new operators.

% Explain how the constraint solving works, and how to design and implement new constraint domains.

% Explain how to debug miniKanren programs.  lol

% Explain the difference between miniKanren and other related languages, including Prolog, Curry, Mercury, and Oz.

% Describe the open problems in relational programming, and limitations of miniKanren.

% [Optional]
% Show how to ``play in the mud'' with non-relational features.

% [Optional]
% Explain design decisions made for miniKanren.

% [Optional]
% Give a history of miniKanren (with help from Dan and Oleg)

% [Optional]
% Describe real-world uses of miniKanren.

\section{Margin Notes}\label{sec:preface:margin-notes}

\marginnote{This book is set using the ``Tufte-Style Book''
  \LaTeX\ style, freely available from
  \url{http://www.LaTeXTemplates.com}}
This book is typeset in the style of Edward Tufte's
magnificent and beautiful \emph{The Visual Display of
  Quantitative Information}\cite{Tufte:1986:VDQ:33404}.  I share
Tufte's love of margin notes,\marginnote{Another great lover of
  marginalia was David Foster Wallace (1962--2008).  The \emph{Harry
    Ransom Center}'s DFW collection includes heavily annotated books
  from Wallace's personal library:
  \url{http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/press/releases/2010/dfw/books/}.
  Wallace's love of margin notes is best demonstrated by his essay 
 ``Host'', in:\cite{dfw:lobster:2005}} and use them in this book to help solve the problem of addressing readers with
widely varying knowledge of computer science and programming.
%
To make the book accessible as possible, in the main text I assume the
reader is the hypothetical \emph{intermediate-level} programmer or
student described in the \emph{Audience} section above.
%
In the margin notes, however, anything goes.

% Rules: try to target intermediate-to-advanced hobbyists, working
% programmers, and undergrad students in main text.  Allowed to geek
% out in margin notes: anything can go!  Intro chapters and appendices
% will help bring intermediate reader up to speed on CS (and,
% especially, PL-related) topics, such as interpreters, continuations,
% type theory, and program transformations.  This shouldn't be too
% boring, though, since can followup these chapters with the same
% ideas demonstrated relationally (for example, relational
% interpreters, relational CSPer, etc.)  Advanced, optional chapters
% and appendices can explore topics of arbitrary complexity.



%%% SPJ style: describe contributions first.  Then, write to satisfy
%%% the contributions.  I'm done writing once I've backed up all of
%%% the claimed contributions.




%%% I should make sure I have plenty of examples of relational
%%% programming not drawn from PL theory, to make the book more
%%% accessible.  Automata and regex are good examples.  Need to look
%%% for more.  Can borrow some ideas from Prolog books.


% Critical questions that should be answered in the preface:


% Who is the intended audience?  (Always keep this in mind...)  For
% the Little books, the intended reader is a bright but ignorant high
% school student.

% What is the required background of the reader?  Tied closely to the
% first question, obviously.
