\chapter{Preface}

% Critical questions that should be answered in the preface:

% What is the goal of the book?  What do I want the reader to get
% out of the book, think about, or be able to do after reading?

% Who is the intended audience?  (Always keep this in mind...)  For
% the Little books, the intended reader is a bright but ignorant high
% school student.

% What is the required background of the reader?  Tied closely to the
% first question, obviously.
