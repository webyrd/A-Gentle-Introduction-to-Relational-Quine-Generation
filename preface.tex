\section{Audience}\label{sec:preface:audience}

\marginnote{\begin{quote}I have attempted to deliver [these lectures] in a spirit that should be recommended to all students embarking on the writing of their PhD theses: imagine that you are explaining your ideas to your former smart, but ignorant, self, at the beginning of your studies!\end{quote}\begin{flushright}\vspace{-1em}---Richard P. Feynman\\\emph{The Feynman Lectures on Computation}\end{flushright}}
This book is written for
intermediate-to-advanced programmers, computer science students, and
researchers.  For this book, \emph{intermediate} means that you are
comfortable writing simple recursive procedures in a functional
programming language, such as Scheme, Racket, Clojure, Lisp, ML, or
Haskell.  I also assume you have a reading knowledge of Scheme.
%
No knowledge of relational programming, logic programming, or programming
language theory is required.

If you want to learn about relational programming, but are new to
programming, Dan Friedman, Oleg Kiselyov, and I have written a book just for you, called
\emph{The Reasoned Schemer}\cite{trs}. In that book we assume you are familiar with the material in \emph{The Little
  Schemer}\cite{Friedman:1996:LS:230223}, which is a very gentle introduction to recursion and
functional programming.

If you are an experienced programmer, but weak on recursion, you, too, might
benefit from \emph{The Little Schemer}.  If you are comfortable with
recursion, but not functional programming, good introductions include
\emph{Scheme and the Art of Programming}\cite{Springer:1989:Art} and
the classic \emph{Structure and Interpretation of Computer
  Programs}\cite{Abelson:1996:SIC:547755}\marginnote{(full text at
\url{http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html})}.

If you are an experienced functional programmer, but do not know
Scheme, the beginning of \emph{Structure and Interpretation of
  Computer Programs} should get you up to speed, while \emph{The
  Scheme Programming Language, 4th Edition}\cite{Dybvig:2009:SPL:1618542}\marginnote{(full text at
\url{http://www.scheme.com/tspl4/})} describes the language in detail.

\section{Margin Notes}\label{sec:preface:margin-notes}

\marginnote{This book is set using the ``Tufte-Style Book''
  \LaTeX\ style, freely available from
  \url{http://www.LaTeXTemplates.com}}
This book is typeset in the style of Edward Tufte's
magnificent and beautiful \emph{The Visual Display of
  Quantitative Information}\cite{Tufte:1986:VDQ:33404}.  I share
Tufte's love of margin notes,\marginnote{Another great lover of
  marginalia was David Foster Wallace (1962--2008).  The \emph{Harry
    Ransom Center}'s DFW collection includes heavily annotated books
  from Wallace's personal library:
  \url{http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/press/releases/2010/dfw/books/}.
  Wallace's love of margin notes is best demonstrated by his essay 
 ``Host'', in:\cite{dfw:lobster:2005}} and use them in this book to help solve the problem of addressing readers with
widely varying knowledge of computer science and programming.
%
To make the book accessible as possible, in the main text I assume the
reader is the hypothetical \emph{intermediate-level} programmer or
student described in the \emph{Audience} section above.
%
In the margin notes, however, anything goes.

% Rules: try to target intermediate-to-advanced hobbyists, working
% programmers, and undergrad students in main text.  Allowed to geek
% out in margin notes: anything can go!  Intro chapters and appendices
% will help bring intermediate reader up to speed on CS (and,
% especially, PL-related) topics, such as interpreters, continuations,
% type theory, and program transformations.  This shouldn't be too
% boring, though, since can followup these chapters with the same
% ideas demonstrated relationally (for example, relational
% interpreters, relational CSPer, etc.)  Advanced, optional chapters
% and appendices can explore topics of arbitrary complexity.



%%% SPJ style: describe contributions first.  Then, write to satisfy
%%% the contributions.  I'm done writing once I've backed up all of
%%% the claimed contributions.


% An important goal of the book is to make other resources on
% miniKanren more accessible.  PL-specific terms should be described,
% or at least the reader should be given very specific pointers to
% additional, accessible reading.


%%% I should make sure I have plenty of examples of relational
%%% programming not drawn from PL theory, to make the book more
%%% accessible.  Automata and regex are good examples.  Need to look
%%% for more.  Can borrow some ideas from Prolog books.


% Critical questions that should be answered in the preface:

% What is the goal of the book?  What do I want the reader to get
% out of the book, think about, or be able to do after reading?

% Who is the intended audience?  (Always keep this in mind...)  For
% the Little books, the intended reader is a bright but ignorant high
% school student.

% What is the required background of the reader?  Tied closely to the
% first question, obviously.
