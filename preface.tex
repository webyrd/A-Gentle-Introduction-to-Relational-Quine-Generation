\chapter{Preface}\label{sec:preface}

I'm about to tell you some of the things I think I know (and many more
things I think I don't know) about my second favorite type of science
fiction, which I call \emph{relational programming}.  Relational
programming is the art of running programs ``backwards.''

Relational programming is not science fiction because it is from the
future.  Rather, like all great science fiction, relational
programming is about changing one aspect of our world---modifying,
adding, or removing one rule or assumption---and seeing what happens.
Relational programming changes our world by adding a single rule that
can never be broken: computer programs are no longer allowed to
distinguish between ``input arguments'' and ``output values.''  That
is, every program must run backwards.

That's it.  And it changes everything.  Let's go!
